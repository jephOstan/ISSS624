#PERSONAL NOTES

## Typology of Cluster Analysis Technique

### **Hierarchical Clustering**

#### **1.1 Agglomerative Clustering ( AGNES or Agglomerative Nesting)**

-   Bottom-up. Plot with dendrogram.
-   Each object initially considered as a single-element cluster (leaf).
-   Algorithm for each step is to combine 2 clusters that are most similar into a new bigger cluster (node).
    -   compute **proximity matrix** before the combination of data points. Subsequently, update the proximity matrix each iteration.

        -   3 common methods to calculate **proximity matrix** :

            **- Euclidean distance**

            **- City-block distance**

            **- Chebychev distance**

    -   common methods :

        -   Maximum / Complete Linkage Clustering

        -   Minimum / Single Linkage Clustering

        -   Mean / Average Linkage

        -   Centroid

        -   Ward's Minimum Variance method

#### **1.2 Divisive Clustering ( DIANA or Divise Analysis )**

-   Top-down.

-   Each step, the most heterogeneous cluster is divided into two.

### **Partitioning Clustering (K-means)**

==========

### **Univariate EDA**

-   check the distribution of the cluster variables.

-   determine the differences in data ranges.

-   variable standardisation techniques if unable to change the scales for the variables' value :

    -   Z-score

    -   Min-max = value range of 0 to 1

    -   Decimal scaling

-   variable standardisation techniques above need to be done first before the transformation for clustering.

### **Bivariate EDA**

-   check the correlation between input variables (i.e. correlation coefficient \>= 0.85).
-   not recommended to apply PCA for highly correlated social economic aspects. Unless clustering analysis is single/home value, e.g. reflection index value from satellite images.
-   VIF (variance inflation factor) method to determine which highly correlated variables not to include in the analysis - regression? (!!!!! confirm this statement)
-   standardisation should not change distribution, should provide quite similar output while transformation can resulted relatively large differences. (!!!!! confirm this statement)

==========

### Spatially Constrained Clustering Methods

2 grouping approaches :

1.  Grouping Objects
    -   grouping similar contiguous objects into new aggregrate areal units.

        -   tension between attribute similarity
2.  Grouping Observations
    -   locational similarity : group spatially contiguous observations only.

==========

### Spatial Kluster Analysis (SKATER) method

-   Construct minimum spanning tree from adjacency graph.

-   Prune the tree (cut edges) to achieve maximum internal homogeneity.

-   Spatially Constrained Clustering using SKATER method.

==========

### Contiguity as a Graph

-   Objective is to minimize within-group dissimilarity (maximize between-group).

-   Network connectivity based on adjacency between nodes (locations).

-   Edge value reflects dissimilarity between nodes.

==========

### Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

-   Connectivity graph, G = (V, L),

    V = vertices (nodes),

    L = edges path - a sequence of nodes connected by edges v1 to vk :\
    (v1,v2), \..., (vk-1,vk).

-   Spanning tree - tree with n nodes of G unique path connecting any two nodes n-1 edges.

-   Minimum spanning tree - spanning tree that minimizes a cost function minimise sum of dissimilarities over all nodes.
