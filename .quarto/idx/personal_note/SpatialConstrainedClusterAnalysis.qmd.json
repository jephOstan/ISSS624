Plot with dendrogram.\n-   Each object initially considered as a single-element cluster (leaf).\n-   Algorithm for each step is to combine 2 clusters that are most similar into a new bigger cluster (node).\n    -   compute **proximity matrix** before the combination of data points. Subsequently, update the proximity matrix each iteration.\n\n        -   3 common methods to calculate **proximity matrix** :\n\n            **- Euclidean distance**\n\n            **- City-block distance**\n\n            **- Chebychev distance**\n\n    -   common methods :\n\n        -   Maximum / Complete Linkage Clustering\n\n        -   Minimum / Single Linkage Clustering\n\n        -   Mean / Average Linkage\n\n        -   Centroid\n\n        -   Ward's Minimum Variance method\n\n#### **1.2 Divisive Clustering ( DIANA or Divise Analysis )**\n\n-   Top-down.\n\n-   Each step, the most heterogeneous cluster is divided into two.\n\n### **Partitioning Clustering (K-means)**\n\n==========\n\n### **Univariate EDA**\n\n-   check the distribution of the cluster variables.\n\n-   determine the differences in data ranges.\n\n-   variable standardisation techniques if unable to change the scales for the variables' value :\n\n    -   Z-score\n\n    -   Min-max = value range of 0 to 1\n\n    -   Decimal scaling\n\n-   variable standardisation techniques above need to be done first before the transformation for clustering.\n\n### **Bivariate EDA**\n\n-   check the correlation between input variables (i.e. correlation coefficient \\>= 0.85).\n-   not recommended to apply PCA for highly correlated social economic aspects. Unless clustering analysis is single/home value, e.g. reflection index value from satellite images.\n-   VIF (variance inflation factor) method to determine which highly correlated variables not to include in the analysis - regression? (!!!!! confirm this statement)\n-   standardisation should not change distribution, should provide quite similar output while transformation can resulted relatively large differences. (!!!!! confirm this statement)\n\n==========\n\n### Spatially Constrained Clustering Methods\n\n2 grouping approaches :\n\n1.  Grouping Objects\n    -   grouping similar contiguous objects into new aggregrate areal units.\n\n        -   tension between attribute similarity\n2.  Grouping Observations\n    -   locational similarity : group spatially contiguous observations only.\n\n==========\n\n### Spatial Kluster Analysis (SKATER) method\n\n-   Construct minimum spanning tree from adjacency graph.\n\n-   Prune the tree (cut edges) to achieve maximum internal homogeneity.\n\n-   Spatially Constrained Clustering using SKATER method.\n\nReference: AssunÇão, R.
